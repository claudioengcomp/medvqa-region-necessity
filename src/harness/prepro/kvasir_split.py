"""Deterministic, image-stratified split of Kvasir-VQA-x1 --
pure logic, no network/GPU (separate from the CLI script in
build_kvasir_clean_split.py, which does the actual download).

Motivation: the official HuggingFace split (train/test) has 94% image
overlap between the two sides. This module groups ALL
unique images (from train+test together) and draws a new split, disjoint
by img_id, stratified by pathology_label so as not to leave an entire rare
clinical category on one side only.
